# MIS-path-tracer
A path tracer that I have done as my final year graphics project. It features a number of different materials, as well as being optimised for performing quicker rendering cycles.

The source codes for the binary will not be disclosed however the GLSL shader code used is made available.

## Optimisations
Optimisations primarily take in the form of:

1. Next event estimation
2. Multiple importance sampling
3. Bounding volume hierarchy
4. Russian roulette
5. Naive ray object intersection
